I see many choices that could be made (and should be tested) when crossing over genes:
- Is "randomness" per-gene or once for the whole crossover? (pick one parent randomly vs pick one gene randomly)
- How are new genes created? (could be from one parent randomly, entirely random, randomly offset from one parent, halfway between the parents, a random interpolation between the parent genes, one of these options randomly, etc.)
- Is the bias treated differently from weights?
- How (if at all) does the relative fitness of the parents effect crossover?
  - Is it just a binary "which is more fit", or a "how much more fit is x compared to y"?
- Probably more I can't think of right now
- When a member of the population is selected as a parent, does that change their odds of being a parent in the future?
  - Maybe once you are a parent, you are removed from the pool of possible parents
  - Or maybe becoming a parent has a "cost" to your fitness for the next round of parent selection
