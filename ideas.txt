I see many choices that could be made (and should be tested) when crossing over genes:
- Is "randomness" per-gene or once for the whole crossover? (pick one parent randomly vs pick one gene randomly)
- How are new genes created? (could be from one parent randomly, entirely random, randomly offset from one parent, halfway between the parents, a random interpolation between the parent genes, one of these options randomly, etc.)
- Is the bias treated differently from weights?
- How (if at all) does the relative fitness of the parents effect crossover?
  - Is it just a binary "which is more fit", or a "how much more fit is x compared to y"?
- Probably more I can't think of right now
